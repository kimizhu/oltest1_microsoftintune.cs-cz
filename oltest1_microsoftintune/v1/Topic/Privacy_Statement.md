# Privacy Statement

## **Privacy Statement**
This privacy statement governs installation and log-in to the Company Portal app.  The Company Portal app is intended for use only by end users of companies with valid subscriptions to the [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] service.  This privacy statement does not apply to use of the Company Portal app once installation and log-in has been completed.  End Users should consult their IT Administrators for further information about their company’s privacy policies with respect to use of the Company Portal app.

You may choose to download and install the Company Portal app onto your computer.  No information is collected by [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] as part of the download process.

In order to access the Company Portal, you will be asked to provide the user name and password (“credentials”) provided to you by your company. Microsoft also will collect and store the IP address and information about the type of browser you use.   We use this information to authenticate your credentials.  This information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities. Microsoft abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.   We may share this information with other companies that we hire to provide limited services on our behalf; we will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.  Microsoft may also access or disclose this information in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Microsoft or our customers, including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of the services; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees, customers, or the public. We may also disclose this information as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.

For more information regarding use of the Company Portal app after you sign-in, please consult your company privacy policy or IT Administrator.  Your Company’s Privacy policy may be available in the Settings Charm displayed within the Company Portal app if your IT Administrator has chosen to enable this feature.
